When an entity provides entity-specific disclosures applying ESRS, it shall consider ISSB Standards as a possible source of additional disclosures (see paragraph AR4 of ESRS 1). In this case, the entity should consider IFRS sector-specific material when preparing entity-specific disclosures, in line with the above mentioned transition provision in ESRS 1.\n\nPoints to consider\nSo long as ESRS sector-specific standards relevant to the entity are not in place: an entity using ESRS E1 that also wants to comply with IFRS S2 is required to refer to and consider the climate-related disclosure topics and metrics of the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 in the instances described above, in line with the transition provision in paragraph 131(b) of ESRS 1.

IFRS S2 specifically requires that an entity shall refer to and consider the Industry‑based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 for: identifying climate-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity’s prospects (see paragraph 12 of IFRS S2), preparing disclosures to meet disclosure requirements in paragraphs 13–22 of IFRS S2 (see paragraph 23 of IFRS S2), determining industry based metrics to disclose (see paragraph 32 of IFRS S2) and identifying and disclosing metrics used to set and monitor targets (see paragraph 37 of IFRS S2).\n\nAs sector-specific standards are not available in ESRS, entities shall report entity-specific information regarding material matters that correspond to their specific situation, while also considering the transition provision in ESRS 1 (see paragraph 131(b) of ESRS 1). When an entity provides entity-specific disclosures applying ESRS, it shall consider ISSB Standards as a possible source of additional disclosures (see paragraph AR4 of ESRS 1). In this case, the entity should consider IFRS sector-specific material when preparing entity-specific disclosures, in line with the above mentioned transition provision in ESRS 1.\n\nPoints to consider\nSo long as ESRS sector-specific standards relevant to the entity are not in place: an entity using ESRS E1 that also wants to comply with IFRS S2 is required to refer to and consider the climate-related disclosure topics and metrics of the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 in the instances described above, in line with the transition provision in paragraph 131(b) of ESRS 1. Following the issuance of ESRS sector-specific standards, different interoperability considerations will apply."

When an entity provides entity-specific disclosures applying ESRS, it shall consider ISSB Standards as a possible source of additional disclosures (see paragraph AR4 of ESRS 1). In this case, the entity should consider IFRS sector-specific material when preparing entity-specific disclosures, in line with the above mentioned transition provision in ESRS 1.\n\nPoints to consider\nSo long as ESRS sector-specific standards relevant to the entity are not in place: an entity using ESRS E1 that also wants to comply with IFRS S2 is required to refer to and consider the climate-related disclosure topics and metrics of the Industry-based Guidance on Implementing IFRS S2 in the instances described above, in line with the transition provision in paragraph 131(b) of ESRS 1.

This can be done by the normalisation of the baseline value, or, by using a baseline value that is derived from a 3-year average if this increases the representativeness and allows a more faithful representation;\n(b) the baseline value and base year shall not be changed unless significant changes in either the target or reporting boundary occur. In such a case, the undertaking shall explain how the new baseline value affects the new target, its achievement and presentation of progress over time. To foster comparability, when setting new targets, the undertaking shall select a recent base year that does not precede the first reporting year of the new target period by longer than 3 years. For example, for 2030 as the target year and a target period between 2025 and 2030, the base year shall be selected from the period between 2022 and 2025;\n(c) the undertaking shall update its base year from 2030 and after every 5-year period thereafter. This means that before 2030, the base years chosen by undertakings’ may be either the currently applied base year for existing targets or the first year of application of the sustainability reporting requirements as set out in Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 (2024, 2025 or 2026) and, after 2030, every 5 years (2030, 2035, etc); and\n(d) when presenting climate-related targets, the undertaking may disclose the progress in meeting these targets made before its current base year. In doing so, the undertaking shall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the information on past progress is consistent with the requirements of this Standard.
